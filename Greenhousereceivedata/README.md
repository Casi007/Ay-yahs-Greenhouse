# Email messages containing RTTY data received via a radio tranmissions


This script monitors the /talk/textout.txt file produced by Fldigi for RTTY transmissions generated by greenhousestatusttsrttysstvrf.py  This script parses the received RTTY transmission data for a call sign and a time stamp (Unix epoch) included in the transmission.  When a valid transmission is received the RTTY data is sent via email using a secure SMTP connection. (e.g. GMail SMTP)  The time stamp is recorded for future comparison to incoming time stamp values to differentiate between rebroadcast tranmssions and updated tranmssions.

# Requirements: 


QSSTV - Qt based slow scan television and fax

Python 3


# 
# Produces:


# Email messages containing SSTV image data received via a radio tranmissions


This script monitors a folder for .png image files produced by QSSTV transmissions generated by greenhousestatusttsrttysstvrf.py  This script locates the most recently created image file in the folder and sends the image as an email message attachment.  The most recent image file name sent via email is recorded for future comparison to prevent retranmission of the same SSTV image file.

# 
# Produces:



Text file and image file uploads to a Dropbox account



dropboxbackuprttysstv.py is a script that uploads Fldigi textout.txt files to
a Dropbox account only after the file is N number of seconds older than the last copy uploaded.
dropboxbackuprttysstv.py also locates and uploads the most recently saved SSTV image
file to a Dropbox account.

# Requirements: 


Fldigi - digital modem program for hamradio operators

Python 3


# 
# Produces:


# Email messages containing RTTY data received via a radio tranmissions


This script monitors the /talk/textout.txt file produced by Fldigi for RTTY transmissions generated by greenhousestatusttsrttysstvrf.py  This script parses the received RTTY transmission data for a call sign and a time stamp (Unix epoch) included in the transmission.  When a valid transmission is received containing specific values (e.g. soil moisture > n, temperature > n, temperature < n) an alarm notice is sent via email using a secure SMTP connection. (e.g. GMail SMTP)  The time stamp is recorded for future comparison to incoming time stamp values to differentiate between rebroadcast tranmssions and updated tranmssions.

# Radio Tranmission Reception Rig Setup


# Hardware

 
Raspberry Pi

2 meter transceiver

ground loop isolation transformer

USB Audio Capture Device

Note: The external speaker output from the 2 meter transceiver is connected to the USB audio capture device through an audio isolation transformer also known as a ground loop isolator.  If a Software-defined radio (SDR) is used in place of a transceiver the isolation transformer and USB audio capture device are unnecessary.
