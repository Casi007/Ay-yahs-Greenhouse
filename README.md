# Ay-yahs-Greenhouse
# Raspberry Pi Greenhouse Automation Project

This is a for-fun project created for the purpose of automating climate control and irrigation in a small greenhouse.

Climate control and irrigation control is achieved by monitoring environmental sensor measurements. The environmental sensors measurements are then used to control a linear actuator, solenoid valve, small fan, and small heating pad. The information produced is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.

# What it does

# Monitors

soil moisture

temperature

humidity

light

# Controls

linear actuator window opener

solenoid valve irrigation control

fan

heating pad

# Installation

# Prerequisites

Adafruit_Python_DHT

Use pip to install from PyPI.

Python 2:

sudo pip install Adafruit_DHT

Python 3:

sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT

This script requires pigpiod.

Install pigpio from the Raspbian package manager:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install pigpio

pigpiod -v

Enable remote gpio access using the raspi-conf tool:

Execute raspi-config

Select menu item 5 Inferfacting Options.

Enable P8 Remote GPIO.

Choose Back

Choose Finish

Place all related file in /home/pi/Greenhouse/

Configure execute permissions on greenhouse.py, powerout.py, and camera.py.

sudo chmod +x greenhouse.py 

sudo chmod +x powerout.py 

sudo chmod +x camera.py 

The greenhouse.py script performs environmental monitoring and the conditional evaluation process. Configure cron to execute greenhouse.py, the primary automation script, every two minutes.

The powerout.py script writes file stored values, relays, and outputs to their default due to power outage. Configure cron to execute powerout.py, the power outage reset defaults script, at boot.

The camera.py script writes one high and one low resolution PNG image to /var/www/html. These images are referenced in the static HTML page generated by greenhouse.py

# Example crontab configuration

sudo crontab -e

\# reset default values, relays, and output states after a power outage

@reboot python /home/pi/Greenhouse/powerout.py

\# capture an image every five minutes

*/5 * * * * python /home/pi/Greenhouse/camera.py


crontab -e

\# execute the primary greenhouse automation script every two minutes

*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/pi/Greenhouse/greenhouse.py
