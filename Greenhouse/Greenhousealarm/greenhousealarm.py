# greenhousealarm.py is a Python script that retrieves the latest
# greenhouse environmental data produced by /Greenhouse/greenhouse.py
# in CSV format using the wget application. greenhousealarm.py
# evaluates the last recorded temperature value and sounds an
# audible notification using the Ubuntu speech-dispatcher when
# the temperature value is not between the minimum and maximum
# threshold.
