# greenhousealarm.py
# Copyright (C) 2019 The Groundhog Whisperer
# greenhousealarm.py is a Python script that retrieves the latest
# greenhouse environmental data produced by /Greenhouse/greenhouse.py
# in CSV format using the wget application. greenhousealarm.py
# evaluates the last recorded temperature value and sounds an
# audible notification using the Ubuntu speech-dispatcher
# and displays a bubble using the notify-send command when 
# the temperature value is not between the minimum and maximum
# threshold.

# greenhousealarm.py can be executed at workstation login.
# 
# Steps for executing greenhousealarm.py at login of an Ubuntu
# workstation.
# 1. Set execute permission on the greenhousealarm.py file
# 2. Select the Applications button launch Startup Applications
# 3. Select the Add button to add an aditional startup program
# 4. Populate a Name value (e.g. Greenhouse Alarm Python Script
# 5. Select the Browse button then navigate to and select
#    the greenhousealarm.py file
# 6. Select the Add button
# 7. Select the Close button
# 8. Logout and back in
