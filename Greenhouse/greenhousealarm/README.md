# greenhousealarm.py 

A Python script that retrieves the latest greenhouse environmental data produced by /Greenhouse/greenhouse.py in CSV format using the wget application. greenhousealarm.py evaluates the last recorded temperature value and sounds an audible notification using the Ubuntu speech-dispatcher and displays a bubble using the notify-send command when the temperature value is not between the minimum and maximum threshold.
