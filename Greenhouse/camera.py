# This is a for-fun project created for the purpose of automating climate
# control and irrigation in a small greenhouse.  This script (camera.py)
# produces a high and low resolution .jpg image and a low resolution
# animated .gif image to the web servers root folder.  These images are
# referenced in the dynamic output produced by index.php and the desktop
# graphical client. This script reads a lumonisity sensor (light
# dependent resistor) connected to an analog to digital converter on a
# Pimoroni Automation hat and adjusts the camera shutter speed for
# high and low light conditions.
#
# Output files produced:
# greenhoushigh.jpg - Static 3280, 2464 jpeg
# greenhouslow.jpg - Static 320, 240 jpeg
# greenhouslow{0-9}.jpg - Static 320, 240 jpegs
# greenhouslow.gif - Animated 320, 240 gif
